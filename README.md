# Weather page

This is a weather page designed for use in various hardware informer screens.  I use it on an iPod Touch 4.

## Usage

1. Go to the [WUnderground API page](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) and create an "Anvil Developer" API key.
2. Checkout
3. `make deploy`
4. Open your.ip:8000 on the informer device.
5. Tap 'settings' and input your API key and the weather station code from WUnderground.
